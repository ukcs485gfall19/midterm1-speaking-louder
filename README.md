Project page for Midterm 1

Planned App features to be displayed as map icons:
* Groups of friends at concerts, festivals, bar hoping, or other social gatherings where mobile alerts are often missed and physical separation is nearly inevitable.
* Search, rescue, and cleanup teams working in a small area.
* Any grouping where resources may need redirection on short notice.
